          <section>
            <p class="middle">I am a first year engineering student at McMaster Univeristy. Planning on specializing in Computer Engineering :D</p>
            <p class="middle">I love writing code and designing applications to aid people around the world.</p>
            <p class="middle">My interests are Artificial intelligence, specifically Machine Learning and web development.</p>
            <p class="middle">I am starting to learn web development to gain more knowledge and skills towards front end work. As someone who loves back end development I want to gain some exposure towards front end development.</p>
            <p class="middle">I know a 4 languages currently. Python, Java, HTML & CSS. Towards the end of summer I plan on learning C++.</p>
            <p class="middle"><b>FUN FACT:</b> I have 2 dogs, a golden doodle and a double doodle. More info can be found about those 2 by clicking link bellow :)</p>
            <p class="middle">View My Projects: <a  href="page2.html" id="link" class="no-underline"><b><i>My Projects</i></b></a></p>
            <p class="middle">Asides from programming I enjoy going to the gym walking my dogs and occasionally playing video games. Weird how I rarely play video games as someone who loves to sit infront of a screen all day right?</p>
