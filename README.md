# PersonalWebsite

##  What is this? 
Welcome to my personal website! This is the start of my front end development journey. I want to step outside my comfort zone and start learning front end development to be a better programmer and engineer. 
This site is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Planning on implementing new frame works as I learn them!
