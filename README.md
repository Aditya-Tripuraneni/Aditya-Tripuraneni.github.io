# PersonalWebsite

##  What is this? 
Welcome to my personal website! This is the start of my front end development journey. I want to step outside my comfort zone and start learning front end development to be a better programmer and engineer. 
This site is made with HTML and CSS. It will be updated with Javascript once I start learning that but for now, it will be a pretty basic site explaining my journey of coding and showcasing some of my cool projects.
